# Contentful's user_interface Styleguide

Welcome to the Contentful's user_interface styleguide.

Here we will gather and standardize common UI elements for Contentful's
Content Management app, known internally as
[user_interface](https://app.contentful.com).

At the time of this writing the styleguide is still very small and maybe
even a bit confusing, but it will be updated and have more content added
over time, as we clean up and refactor different parts of our CSS and as
we create new elements.

More information about our CSS Guidelines will also be added at some
point.

This styleguide is generated with [node-kss](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node)
