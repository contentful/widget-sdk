        "title": "5 Lessons in Contentment from Billionaires Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger",
        "author": "Leo Babauta",
        "post": "I sat in a crowd of 45,000 about 10 days ago, watching super-billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger riff off each other and deliver quick wit and worldly wisdom about finances and life in general, at the famous Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha.\n\nAs I listened to these titans of the investing world, it struck me how content they are.\n\nNot just content because they have all the riches in the world and all their needs met (they do), but because they understand fundamentals of contentment with life, which I believe is a superpower.\n\nIt was amazing to listen to these two masters talk about investing, but learn lessons in contentment throughout the investing advice.\n\nToday, to go along with my new, free ebook, The Little Book of Contentment, I’d like to share what I learned from Warren and Charlie.\n\nI’d like to thank my friends Jake & Lonnie of Farnham Street Investments (and Mike & Scott of Cumbre Capital) for the once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nLessons in Contentment from Warren & Charlie\nThe key lessons:\n\n“Find what turns you on.” Warren said this in response to a question about what advice he’d give to his younger self 50 years ago. He wasn’t talking about sex, but about what you do for a living. And while we’ve all heard “Do what you love”, it’s telling that this is the one thing he’d tell his younger self — it’s that important to happiness. If you do what turns you on, you will be much further along the road to contentment.\nDon’t worry about what everyone else is doing. Charlie, who is impressively intelligent, said one of the big advantages that Berkshire Hathaway has had is that Warren & Charlie don’t need to worry about what everyone else is doing (in the investment world). Too many people get caught up in watching everyone else, and letting that influence them, that they lose their inner compass. Instead, figure out the guiding principles that matter the most to you, and let go of the need to check on what everyone else is doing, and the need to compare what you’re doing with everyone else.\nKnow your strengths. These two guys are very aware of their limitations — they almost never invest in tech companies, for example, because they don’t understand it well — and instead of feeling the need to go into their weak areas, they stay with their strong areas. They know what they’re strong at, and focus on that. Letting go of the need to do everything, and being happy with focusing on less, is an important contentment lesson.\nFewer and higher quality. Warren & Charlie have a “fewer is better” investment philosophy, where they aren’t nearly as active as your usual Wall Street investor … but they focus on a handful of really strong investments. Warren suggests that investors imagine they have a punchcard with 20 punch holes … once you make 20 investments in your lifestime, your punchcard is used up. If you did this, you’d really make them count. This is the guiding principle, btw, in my book The Power of Less. You don’t need more — instead, be more discerning, and happy with less.\nKnow what you like and forget the rest. Warren Buffet, one of the world’s wealthiest men, has a nice but modest house and a surprisingly modest Cadillac (that he drives himself), and eats at his favorite (but pretty ordinary) restaurants … he can afford much more extravagance, but forgoes it because he knows the simple things he likes in life. He could have much, much more, but knows that he doesn’t need it. How many of us do that? Just enjoy the things we like, and not worry about what else we could be enjoying, or what everyone else is enjoying.\nThere will be some who say, “Sure, it’s easy to be content when you’re rich and successful,” but I think this is missing the point. They are successful because of these lessons.\n\nI learned that inspiration for contentment can be found in surprising places, including in Omaha, where everyone I met had a kind word for me, and a smile on their faces. I left with a smile myself.",

        "author": "Leo Babauta",
        "post": "I had that chance recently, as I sat down with Tim Ferriss, who just launched his massive new book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life.\nTim spent some intense months learning how to do the thing that has kicked his butt for his entire life: cooking. He sucked at cooking, and decided to conquer it, and in the process shows us how to learn anything, from languages to sports to survival skills. The book teaches us how to cook, but more importantly, it teaches us the art and science of learning.\nSo I sat down with Tim to talk about learning, and asked questions submitted by Zen Habits readers the week before:\nWhat is your set protocol for when you catch yourself procrastinating?\nHow are we supposed to devote several months to learning when we have 9-5 job, family, etc?\nDo rules set us free? More specifically, is habit essential when trying to be productive?\nDo you know any secrets to self-imposed moderation? For alcohol, food, or anything really.\nLearning something new involves memory. How important is a good memory in learning? How can I improve my memory?\nWatch the video below, or download it here to watch on your iPad/iPhone or later on your computer.\nAnd when you’re done, check out Tim’s incredible book, The 4-Hour Chef.",
