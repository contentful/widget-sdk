  %h2.uppercase Markdown Basics
  %p Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read plain text format, which is then formatted for viewing on devices and browsers serving content from Contentful API. Think of it as a stripped down version of HTML. Scroll down below for tips on how to use markdown syntax.

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="paragraphs") Paragraphs
  %p Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.
  %code
    The raven paradox, also known as Hempel's paradox or Hempel's ravens, is a paradox arising from the question of what constitutes evidence for a statement. 
    %br
    %br
    Observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black – even though, intuitively, these observations are unrelated.

  %h2.uppercase Line breaks
  %p If you wish to create a line break you need to leave two spaces at the end of a line, otherwise they will still be rendered on the same line
  %code
    This is a line with two spaces at the end
    %br
    And this is another line
    %br
    This is one line with no spaces at the end And this is a second line after it

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="headings") Headings
  %p You can create a heading by adding one or more # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
  %code
    :plain 
      # The largest heading<br>
      ## The second largest heading<br>
      ### The third largest heading

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="blockquotes") Blockquotes
  %p You can indicate blockquotes with a &gt;, just like you do in email.
  %code
    To quote topographic scholars:
    %br
    %br
    &gt; There are three types of people in this world: those who know how to count and those who don’t!

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="styling") Styling text
  %p You can make text bold (one asterisk), italic (two asterisks), or strikethrough (two tilde signs).
  %code
    :plain
      *This text will be italic*<br>
      **This text will be bold**<br>
      ~~This text will have a strike through it~~<br>
  %p Both bold and italic can use either a * or a _ around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.
  %code
    :plain
      **Everyone _must_ attend the 5 o'clock tea at Lady Mae’s house.**

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="lists") Unordered lists
  %p You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either a * or a -.
  %code
    :plain
      * Item<br>
      * Item<br>
      * Item<br>
      <br>
      - Item<br>
      - Item<br>
      - Item

  %h2.uppercase Ordered lists
  %p You can make an ordered list by preceding list items with a number.
  %code
    1. Item 1
    %br
    2. Item 2
    %br
    3. Item 3

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="links") Links
  %p There are two ways to create links - doing it inline or creating a reference. In both cases, the link text is delimited by [square brackets]. 
  %code
    This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link. 
    %br
    [This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
  %p For reference-style links, use a second set of square brackets for any label to identify the link: 
  %code
    This is [an example][id] reference-style link. 
    %br
    This is [another example] [foo] reference-style link. 
  %p Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself: 
  %code
    [id]: http://example.com/ "Optional Title Here" 
    %br
    [foo]: http://anotherexample.com/ "Optional Title Here" 
    %br
    [id]: http://example.com/ 'Optional Title with Single Quotes Here' 
    %br
    [foo]: http://anotherexample.com/ (Optional Title with Parentheses Here)

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="images") Images
  %p To include images, use the following syntax to the define the image and the alt attribute:
  %code
    \![Alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg)

  %p Or with a title attribute
  %code
    \![Alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg "Title text")


  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="code") Code blocks
  %p
    To include examples of source code in the text, simply intend every line of the block by at least 4 spaces.
    Your text will be displayed as a code.
    Alternatively you can surround your code block with lines containing three backticks
  %code
    :plain
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foo(123);<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar('baz');<br>
      <br>
      ```<br>
      foo(123);<br>
      bar('baz');<br>
      ```<br>

  %h2.uppercase(data-anchor="rules") Horizontal rules
  %p You can produce a horizontal rule by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. 
  %code
    :plain
      *** This will produce a line below<br>
      --- This will also produce a line below<br>
      ___ Lo and behold, this will produce a line below as well
  %p
    When using three hyphens, there should not be text above the hyphens but a blank line instead.
    A line of text followed by a line with hyphens would be turned into a headline instead.
