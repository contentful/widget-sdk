The Netlify App gives content editors control over static site builds and makes the process more transparent.

---

### This app provides the following functionality:

- triggers Netlify builds with a simple click in the sidebar
- displays build status so editors don't preview outdated sites
- brings Netlify functionality into the Contentful web app
- makes it possible to configure on a per-content-type level

---

### To use this app, you need:

- a static site based on a service such as Gatsby, Middleman or Hugo
- your site configured to load content from Contentful and its code pushed to a remote repository, such as GitHub or Gitlab
- a Netlify setup where the site is connected to the remote repository and enabled for continuous deployment

---
