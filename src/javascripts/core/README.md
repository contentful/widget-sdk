## Core

- Core modules can be imported by any feature.
- Core modules know nothing about concrete features and can't import any files from feature folders.

Principles to follow when writing the core code:

- Write more tests
- Carefully designed API and avoiding breaking changes
- More diligent code reviews
- Typed language if possible
