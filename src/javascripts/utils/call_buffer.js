 * @ngdoc service

 * @description
 * A service that records function calls while in the initial
 * open state. When the buffer is resolved, buffered computations
 * are executed.
 *
 * Afterwards, subsequent computations are executed immediately
 * and synchronously.
 *
 * Instead of resolving the buffer can also be disabled. That
 * discards all buffered function calls. Future calls are discarded
 * immediately.
 *
 * After being resolved or disabled, the buffer can not be
 * transitioned into another state anymore.
