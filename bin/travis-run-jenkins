# This script triggers a build of the UI Integration Test Suite on Jenkins.
#
# The script is run after the deployment and triggers a test run
# against the built commit on `app.flinkly.com`. Jenkins then sets the
# CI status on Github.
#
# For builds of the master branch we trigger the full test suite on the 'Staging
# Custom UI Version' job. We skip the preview and production branches. For all
# other branches we run the smoke tests on the 'User Interface Pull Request' job.
#
# The jenkins credentials are provided in encrypted form in
# `.travis.yml`. They are defined in the Jenkins Job configuration.
