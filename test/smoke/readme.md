# Smoke tests

The tests in this directory are for testing critical functionality (critical paths) of the web app. They ensure that the most important parts of our app are working as expected and to a known specification, and are meant as a "last resort" check of critical functionality.

More detailed documentation exists in [`/docs/guides/smoke-tests.md`](../../docs/guides/smoke-tests.md).

In addition, for high level information about the smoke tests and critical paths in general, please see the Confluence pages on [the critical paths](https://contentful.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2785312930) and [smoke tests](https://contentful.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2794029205).
