# CSS refactoring

Come up with a more structured plan for this.

Some main points:
- get rid of complex selectors
- get rid of nesting
- remove duplication where possible
- get rid of class declarations spread out across different files and different points in files
- create a styleguide, together with a better naming scheme for different CSS blocks

- increase use of @extends to reduce CSS size
