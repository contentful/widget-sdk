TODO
====

- unify newObject methods (wrap without server call)

- Rename BaseObject to Entity

- deleting objects

- Do not create sub objects when current object has no id
  _OR_
  ignore this behavior and consistently assume well-formed objects. No more
  checking for null ids
- shared BaseObject tests: catch where behavior differs, verify constructor signature

Test Cleanup
------------

- In the tests mock away what we don't actually test. We are actually always
  instantiating a whole hierarchy of objects although we really only need the
  persistenceContext. That was the whole point of the excercise
- Test the base adapter
- Test the node adapter
- Split up the retrieval/create methods in the bucket test into several files
  (Maybe not only split tests, also code). Tests get simpler if we remove
  null id checks
