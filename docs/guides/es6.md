Writing ES6
===========

Angular services can no can be written using ES6 syntax and are transpiled with
[Babel][babel].

ES6 transpilation is enabled for files with the `.es6.js` extension. See the
[ES6 Modules](#es6-modules) section for more info on how to integrate ES6 code
with Angular.

We use a restricted set of Babel transform plugins that we will extend when
necessary. See `tools/app-babel-options.js` for the list of supported plugins.

ES6 syntax is not yet supported for directives and controllers.

Adding a Transform Plugin
-------------------------

To add support for an ES6 feature one needs to adjust the Babel configuration
and the ESLint configuration. The babel configuration is located in
`tools/app-babel-options.js`

Be sure to prefer the `loose` option for plugins if available. This will create
less correct code but it will be more portable without using polyfills.


Linting
-------

We have to different ESLint configurations `src/javascripts/.eslint-es5.yml` and
`src/javascripts/.eslint-es6.yml` for ES5 and ES6 files, repectively.

The ES6 configuration excludes ES6 syntax that is not transformed through the
[`no-restricted-syntax` rule][no-restricted-syntax-rule]. If you add a Babel
plugin make sure to also update the ESLint configuration.

We use two shell scripts `bin/lint-all` and `bin/lint-file` to lint against the
appropriate configuraiton. You can use the latter to integrate ESLint into your
code editor or IDE.

ES6 Modules
-----------

The ES6 module syntax (using the keywords `import` and `export`) is transpiled
into code that is then plugged into Angularâ€™s DI module system.

Assume the file `src/javascripts/a/b/x.es6.js` has the following export
~~~js
export default const def = 'default'
export const foo = 'foo'
~~~
This file is transformed into an Angular service with its name `a/b/x` derived
from the file name. Thus, from Angular we can import this file as follows.
~~~js
var X = $injector.get('a/b/x')
assert.equal(X.default, 'default')
assert.equal(X.foo, 'foo')
~~~

Conversely, we can import Angular services in ES6 modules.
~~~js
import * as X from 'x'
~~~
is equivalent to
~~~
var X = $injector.get('x')
~~~

We also support relative imports. Assume the file `src/javascripts/a/b/x.es6.js`
has the following import.
~~~js
import * as Y from '../y'
import * as Z from './z'
~~~
Imports are resolved relative to the module ID (which coincides with the service
name) of the file they are used in. Since the file above has the module ID
`a/b/c` this is equivalent to
~~~js
var Y = $injector.get('a/y')
var Z = $injector.get('a/b/z')
~~~

The implementation uses the [SystemJS Babel plugin][babel-systemjs] and is
provided in `src/javascripts/prelude.js`.
