# `slide_in_editor` event
Event for tracking user behavior on the slide-in reference navigation feature.

## Questions this event should allow us to answer:
* How many levels deep do users navigate?
* Do users navigating by using...
  * the "←" back arrow on the top entity?
  * peeking?
  * clicking a layer without peeking?
* Do users go back level by level vs. multiple levels at a time?

## Schema
Snowplow schema: [slide_in_editor/1.0.0.json](https://github.com/contentful/com.contentful-schema-registry/blob/master/schemas/com.contentful/slide_in_editor/jsonschema/1-0-0)

We track all of the following cases using the "`slide_in_editor`" event:

* Click on a slide to navigate back (potential peeking)
  * `action`: `"peek_click"`
  * `current_slide_level`: e.g. `2` for second slide-in level (3rd open entity)
  * `target_slide_level`: e.g. `0` for root level
  * `peek_hover_time_ms`: how long the user hovered on the slide (in ms) before clicking on it
* Click on "←" back arrow of a slided-in entity
  * `action`: `"arrow_back"`
  * `current_slide_level`
  * `target_slide_level`: always `current_slide_level - 1`
* Click on the Bulk editor's "Close" button
  * `action`: `"arrow_back"`
  * `current_slide_level`
  * `target_slide_level`: always `current_slide_level - 1`
* Click on a reference or creating a new entity from a reference field, resulting in slide-in
  * `action`: `"open" | "open_create"`
  * `current_slide_level`
  * `target_slide_level` *Note:* Can be smaller than `current_slide_level` in case of a circular reference.
* Entity "action > delete" which indirectly results in the top slide being closed
  * `action`: `"delete"`
  * `current_slide_level`
  * `target_slide_level`: always `current_slide_level - 1`
* (Dropped/TBD) ~~Use of native browser history back or forward button~~
  * ~~`action`: `"browser_back" | "browser_forward"`~~
  * ~~`current_slide_level`~~
  * ~~`target_slide_level`~~
