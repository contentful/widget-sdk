The Web App is like a country.

Not the greatest one, there are some shitty roads, you need to wait for hours in public offices and there's a neighbor we've got some issues with. But we're a democracy, education and healthcare is provided and many people around the globe like us.

Could be better but not the worst situation to be in.

What do countries have? TAXES!

## The Web App Tax Rates

1. For each sprint in which you contributed to the `user_interface` repository, you're obliged to prepare and merge a change which will result in at least `-1` decrement in either Angular or Jade section of the [Web App Project Sniffer](https://user-interface-sniffer.netlify.com/pr-log).
2. If you're a member of privileged class and only work in 100% React codebases, in addition to (1) you're obliged to prepare and merge another change which will result in at least `-1` decrement in either Angular or Jade section of the [Web App Project Sniffer](https://user-interface-sniffer.netlify.com/pr-log).
3. If you're merging changes that result in an increment of either Angular or Jade count in the [Web App Project Sniffer](https://user-interface-sniffer.netlify.com/pr-log) you're basically stealing other people's tax contributions!!! You'll have to repay by contributing a change that results in a `-5` decrement in either Angular or Jade section of the [Web App Project Sniffer](https://user-interface-sniffer.netlify.com/pr-log). If the rule is not observed, you'll have to wear the [T-Shirt of Shame](https://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-T-Shirt-JavaScript-Programmer-Shirts/dp/B01J659MGM) for 5 consecutive work days.
4. If you introduce a new dependency to the `package.json` file, you are obliged to eliminate one dependency from the same file. Group of dependencies don't have to match: you can introduce a new production dependency and remove one dev dependency.
5. You're completely free to pay more taxes!
