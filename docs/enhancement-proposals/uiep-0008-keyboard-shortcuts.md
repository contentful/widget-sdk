# [UIEP-0008] Document Keyboard Shortcut Guidelines in Forma 36

## Introduction

Keyboard shortcuts enable power users to boost their own productivity by providing an efficient way to perform repetitive or common tasks.

## Description

My proposal is to introduce keyboard shortcut guidelines to Forma 36.

## Motivation

Empower teams to implement keyboard shortcuts and prevent decision paralysis. Currently a hacktag team are delayed in shipping a fully-realised version of their feature as they lacked guidance in choosing a shortcut to trigger their feature.

## Risks

The risks are common to all F36 documentation additions - the information is unclear, or not communicated.

## Outcome

https://contentful.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DES/pages/1504772118/Global+keyboard+shortcut+guidelines+proposal - This is a link to the draft document of what will end up in the guidelines section of http://f36.contentful.com.
